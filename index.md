## Ciao ðŸ‘‹
Francesco here :) I deal with **Deep Learning**, with a particular interest in **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

Born and raised in the suburbs of Rome, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ I would have never thought I'd say this one day, but I like:
(1) Research, (2) [Reinforcement Learning](https://x.com/_fracapuano/status/1517495613788721155/photo/1), (3) [Blues](https://open.spotify.com/album/5xQz73Q2PPi3xeoLrg1uce?si=J_T92eMcTASY3HJ0c2Zhsw), (4) [BJJ](http://fracapuano.github.io/personal/blog/2023/05/19/bjj.html), and (5) [travelling](http://fracapuano.github.io/personal/blog/2023/05/19/two-years-of-travels.html) (usually in this order). 

I am currently working at Hugging Face, making cute robots smarter alongside [Remi Cadene](https://remicadene.com) and our amazing team at [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot).

## Research Interests

- **Main: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Robot Learning**, Meta-Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning
- Misc: Continual Reinforcement Learning, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search, Machine Learning for Science
