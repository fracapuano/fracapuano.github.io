## Ciao ðŸ‘‹
Francesco here :) I deal with **Deep Learning**, with a particular interest in **Robot Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

Born and raised in the suburbs of Rome, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ I would have never thought I'd say this one day, but I like:
(1) Research, (2) [Reinforcement Learning](https://x.com/_fracapuano/status/1517495613788721155/photo/1), (3) [Blues](https://open.spotify.com/album/5xQz73Q2PPi3xeoLrg1uce?si=J_T92eMcTASY3HJ0c2Zhsw), (4) [BJJ](http://fracapuano.github.io/personal/blog/2023/05/19/bjj.html), and (5) [travelling](http://fracapuano.github.io/personal/blog/2023/05/19/two-years-of-travels.html) (usually in this order).

I am currently working towards my PhD ("DPhil") at the University of Oxford, where I am supervised by [Ingmar Posner](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner) at [A2I](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i) and [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) at [FLAIR](https://foersterlab.com/).

I also regularly contribute to open-source projects including [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) as a Research Fellow.

## Research Interests

- **Main: Robot Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning**, Meta-Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning
- Misc: Continual Reinforcement Learning, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search, Machine Learning for Science
