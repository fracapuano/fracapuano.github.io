## About me

Ciao! Francesco here, born and raised in the suburbs of Rome, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. <br>
Growing up I would have never thought I'd say this one day, but I like:
- Research, 
- [Reinforcement Learning](https://x.com/_fracapuano/status/1517495613788721155/photo/1),
- [BJJ](https://x.com/_fracapuano/status/1924481637301051580),
- ..., and [airports]() 

(usually in this order). I am currently working at Hugging Face, making cute robots smarter alongside [Remi Cadene](https://remicadene.com) and the team at [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot).

## Research Interests

- **Main: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Robot Learning**, Meta-Reinforcement Learning, Transfer Learning
- Misc: Continual Reinforcement Learning, Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search, Machine Learning for Science
