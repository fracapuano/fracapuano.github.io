title: "Privilege sounds like “You work too much”"

In the last couple of years, fortune materialized itself as working out of nice offices, often with amazing appliances. I have lived this as quite a change from dusty break-rooms back in Rome, and from using my employee discount to pay for every coffee while at Eataly. 
Across the many significant changes in the recent years, this part of moving into the **tech industry** is perhaps the one I have noted the most. 
All in all, I am extremely lucky to have maintained close contact with people reminding me these fancy city views, free lunches, and complimentary coffee are not the norm, rather they're the exception.

In this, the tech industry has been a safe haven, where words like “culture”, “resting” and “balance” have a true meaning, especially in countries where **ordinary people** are not becoming richer (France's GDP per capita is declining, Italy's has been stagnating since I can remember). 
In this warm, detached, and privileged scenario, I can't help it but to feel few know that the overwhelming majority of ordinary people carry on lives which look very, very different from all of this. 
Most people---one might even say, virtually everyone---put in just about all they have to make ends meet (which is an increasingly challenging objective in most countries in Europe, us Europeans need to change this).

People who work in the service industry, blue-collar workers, and really anyone working a job easy to explain to their grandparents spend increasingly long hours working, resorting to overtime to make more than "barely enough", when they don't have second jobs altogether.
This is the reality **most people face day-to-day**. This is the reality the people I looked up to growing up and I come from: hard-working people. 
We Italians (should) take great pride in the fact our Constitution clearly states the Republic is founded on labour" (art.1)---labour is a value, and since a very young age I have witnessed this in practice in my own family. 
I was lucky to see early on what it means to be working as much as one needs to, not as much as one likes.

For a very long time, I thought all of this was just what people do. **Then, I got lucky.**  I can still remember my first day on the job---a day when, a trained engineer like myself, literally struggled for minutes to figure out the way to pour water out a design bottle. Eventually, I succeded, and promptly familiarized myself with the thought that bottle was really just unnecessarily pompous, something I felt ever after that first encounter. 
For a very brief amount of time, I thought everyone felt exactly the same, and that it was just impossible to feel any different. 
Then, off-guard and with my great surprise, I found out about the **very, very loud minority** of people among which I now live and work since two years. This blogpost is about *Them*.

First in gorgeous Boggi suits and carefully picked dresses, then wearing their new **startup uniform ("On" sneakers)**, I met true embodiments of how amazing young adulthood is---living proofs it can be much more than being confronted with the duty of being responsible for oneself.
In all honesty, I should say I am not even entirely sure most of the people around me are faced with this responsibility at all.
To a very large extent, a passion for summer houses in Sardegna, obsessive running club attendance, and excellent knowledge of Asia makes up for more than necessary responsibilities.
While it's hard to balance work with just as-important hobbies and passions, I am constantly reminded of how them manage nonetheless.

This blogpost is directed to **normal people in parts of society feeling like an exception to the norm**, and about the feeling of an **impossible and unfair balance**.
By now, I have had it just about a million times: just after we are done discussing plans for whatever long weekend might be coming up, or the resolve to train for the next marathon, *They* start talking about the importance of balance. Sometimes, I am lucky enough to receive advice on the importance of working less, to improve on **"work-life balance"**---a foreign concept to millions of ordinary people here, in Europe.

For the record, I am a 25yo Italian expat in France while I write this, I deeply enjoy and find very fulfilling my work, hence I willingly do it for long hours. 
I also celebrate having come a long way from how bad I was at comparing labour with my other values (in 2018 I purposefully skipped Christmas with family and New Years with friends to pick up some €150/shift with overtime; I slept less than 5 hours a night for the first two years of Engineering school). 
Still, I am not the point: the point is the advice of **"working less"** is wrong, unfit for those of us who have known what a normal life in today's economy looks like. 
In virtually every occasion is a good-hearted advice, coming from a privileged position that is simply unaware of the sacrifices ordinary people need to do to get free coffee on the job. Simply out of touch.

Playing devils advocate---to work less is terrific advice for those whose ambitions are normal sized, or feeling safe. I just argue this advice is just not general enough. 
Further, it serves the cause I care about the most---**social mobility**---horribly. 
In my experience, those who can't count on personal connections, social capital, financial resources, or really anything besides getting luck with a first "yes", tend to make it by **maximizing their exposure to luck**. By definition, this requires time, commitment, and personal investment.
In practice, that also mean pushing harder---read this as working more---not because the potential upsides become better—--they don't—--but because the certain downsides do.

Someone I really admire once said "your company is not diverse if everyone comes from the same School", and I agree. 
Surrounded by people who seemed to all have gone through the same path in life, I found upper society's most shameless sin to be thinking the world is just one way. 
For what is worth it, this is a piece sharing the lesson I have learned: not listen, and continue seeking the true fulfillment one can carve out of labour.
Something else I learned is to **not take any advice from people wearing "On"**, but that might be besides the point.
