In the last few years, my grandfather lived overcome by the confusion of his illness, that illness so many of us know and which we all fear. 
The strength I once saw in his hands gave way to increasingly feeble gestures; his ever-joyful spirit to the sorrowful gazes of his final days.

Yet, despite how hard this can be, I cannot remember my grandfather like this at all. 
I remember him on the Sunday mornings when he would take my brother and me to pick up herbs for Grandma's sauce, and how he showed my brother and I what the world was, and what childhood was–what it means to be a child—--through his own eyes of wonder. 
I remember him playing with my sister and making her laugh, aloud, singing together, loving her, and showing her that good men exist.

This is how I remember my Nonno: as a good man. Steady, secure, and firm in his obligations. 
I remember him as the man I saw getting up late at night and early in the morning, well past his seventies, to go to work. 
I remember him dedicated to asking nothing for noone, dedicated to providing for himself, his caring wife, his two daughters, and the three grandchildren he had always had at home, and will continue to have.

I remember my grandfather as the person who taught me and many others the values of family and hard work, all without ever even having to say a word, simply by working for himself and his family. 
I remember him as the man who showed me how to shave and how to wear a tie. 
I remember his way of teaching me, my brother, and I hope many others, how to shake hands with the world–with the firmness and the good-natured kindness he always possessed, and which is now ours to carry forward.
